Hi there!

I'm ZYZhao.My major in College is Logistics Engineering.Now I'm working as a Web front-end programmer, and looking forward to becoming a full-stack architect.I love coding and different kinds of innovation technologies.

Hoping I could encounter many friends who want to improve themselves just like me.
